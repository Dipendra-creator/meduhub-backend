🔥 NEXT STEPS - Download Firebase Service Account Key
================================================

Your code is ready! Now you need to get the Firebase credentials:

STEP 1: Go to Firebase Console
   👉 https://console.firebase.google.com/project/meduhub-52922/settings/serviceaccounts/adminsdk

STEP 2: Click "Generate new private key"

STEP 3: Click "Generate key" in the popup

STEP 4: A JSON file will download - save it as:
   serviceAccountKey.json
   
STEP 5: Move the file to:
   C:\Users\dipus\Desktop\New folder\meduhub-backend\serviceAccountKey.json

STEP 6: Run the server:
   node server.js

That's it! Your backend will now use Firebase Firestore instead of MongoDB.

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Do NOT commit serviceAccountKey.json to GitHub!
(It's already in .gitignore, so you're protected)
